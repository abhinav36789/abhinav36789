### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Abhinav

## A Little Bit About Me :sunglasses:

I am a student at Satish Chandra College Snatakotter Mahavidyalaya, Ballia.

I am a data-driven problem solver with a passion for leveraging data to drive business outcomes. I have spent some time developing my skills in business analytics, data manipulation, and data structures. My experience involves building compelling reports on top of structured data models using tools such as Microsoft Power BI and Excel, and I leveraged my skills in Python and SQL to manipulate and analyze data.

As I continue to grow my skills and expertise, I am eager to collaborate with others and contribute to meaningful projects in the field of data analytics. Whether it's creating innovative visualizations, or uncovering insights that drive business growth, I am committed to using my skills to make a positive impact.

**I recommend looking through the pinned repositories which showcase my skills.**

I spend my free time playing Chess.
